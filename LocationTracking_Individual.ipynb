    "The following code was designed in order to track the location of a single animal across the course of a single video session.  After initally loading in the video, the user is able to crop the video frame using a rectangle selection tool.  A background reference frame is then specified, either by taking a median of several frames in the video, or by the user providing a short video of the same environment without an animal in it.  By comparing each frame in the video to the reference frame, the location of the animal can be tracked.  It is imperative that the reference frame of the video is not shifted from the actual video.  For this reason, if a separate video is supplied, it is best that it be acquired on the same day as the behavioral recording.  The animal's center of mass, in x,y coordinates, is then recorded, as well as the distance in pixels that the animal moves from one frame to the next. Lastly, the user can specify regions of interest in the frame (e.g. left, right) using a polygon drawing tool and record for each frame whether the animal is in the region of interest.  Options for summarizing the data are also provided. "

    "Location tracking examines the deviance of each frame in a video from the reference frame on a pixel by pixel basis.  For each frame it calculates the center of mass for these differences (COM) to define the center of the animal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`loc_thresh` : This parameter represents a percentile threshold and can take on values between 0-100.  Each frame is compared to the reference frame.  Then, to remove the influence of small fluctuations, any differences below a given percentile (relative to the maximum difference) are set to 0.  We use a value of 99.5 with good success.\n",
    "\n",
    "`use_window` : This parameter is incredibly helpful if objects other than the animal temporarily enter the field of view during tracking (such as an experimenter’s hand manually delivering a stimulus or reward).  When use_window is set to True, a square window with the animal's position on the prior frame at its center is given more weight when searching for the animal’s location (because an animal presumably can't move far from one frame to the next).  In this way, the influence of objects entering the field of view can be avoided.  If use_window is set to True, the user should consider window_size and window_weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "`window_size` : This parameter only impacts tracking when use_window is set to True.  This defines the size of the square window surrounding the animal that will be more heavily weighted in pixel units.  We typically set this to 2-3 times the animal’s size (if an animal is 100 pixels at its longest, we will set window_size to 200).  Note that to determine the size of the animal in pixels, the user can reference any image of the arena presented in ezTrack, which has the pixel coordinate scale on its axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`window_weight` : This parameter only impacts tracking when use_window is set to True.  When window_weight is set to 1, pixels outside of the window are not considered at all; at 0, they are given equal weight. Notably, setting a high value that is still not equal to 1 (e.g., 0.9) should allow ezTrack to more rapidly find the animal if, by chance, it moves out of the window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`method` : This parameter determines the luminosity of the object ezTrack will search for relative to the background and accepts values of 'abs', 'light', and 'dark'. Option 'abs' does not take into consideration whether the animal is lighter or darker than the background and will therefore track the animal across a wide range of backgrounds. 'light' assumes the animal is lighter than the background, and 'dark' assumes the animal is darker than the background. Option 'abs' generally works well, but there are situations in which you may wish to use the others.  For example, if a tether is being used that is opposite in color to the animal (a white wire and a black mouse), the ‘abs’ method is much more likely to be biased by the wire, whereas option ‘dark’ will look for the darker mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "`rmv_wire` : When rmv_wire is set to True, an algorithm is used to attempt to remove wires from the field of view.  If rmv_wire is set to True, the user should consider wire_krn.\n",

    "# Instructions\n",
    "The following code was designed in order to track the location of a single animal across the course of a single video session.  After initally loading in the video, the user is able to crop the video frame using a rectangle selection tool.  A background reference frame is then specified, either by taking a median of several frames in the video, or by the user providing a short video of the same environment without an animal in it.  By comparing each frame in the video to the reference frame, the location of the animal can be tracked.  It is imperative that the reference frame of the video is not shifted from the actual video.  For this reason, if a separate video is supplied, it is best that it be acquired on the same day as the behavioral recording.  The animal's center of mass, in x,y coordinates, is then recorded, as well as the distance in pixels that the animal moves from one frame to the next. Lastly, the user can specify regions of interest in the frame (e.g. left, right) using a polygon drawing tool and record for each frame whether the animal is in the region of interest.  Options for summarizing the data are also provided. \n",

For each frame, a square window with the animal's position on the prior frame at its center is given more weight when searching for it's location (because an animal presumably can't move far in a fraction of a second).  When window_weight is set to 1, pixels outside of the window are not considered at all; at 0, they are given equal weight.  Notably, setting a high value that is still not equal to 1 (e.g. 0.9) should allow the program to more rapidly find the animal if by chance it moves out of the window.\n",

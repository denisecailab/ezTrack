If the user is unsure of the frame rate, this information will be output by ezTrack when Cell 3 is run.  Note that for longer videos, it is not necessary to calibrate based upon the total number of frames in the video.\n",

    "`dsmpl` : The amount to down-sample each frame.  If processing is going slow, down-sampling can help. A value of 1 indicates no down-sampling, while a value of 0.25 indicates that the frame will be down-sampled to ¼ the original size.  Note that if the user chooses to down-sample in the calibration step, this same down-sampling factor should be used for processing behavioral videos and vice versa.\n",

    "`stretch` : Allows the user to alter the aspect ratio of the presented output.  This is useful when videos have irregular dimensions and are difficult to see (e.g., an aspect ratio of 1:100).  The width/height will be scaled by the factor provided. Note that this only affects the appearance of visualizations and does not modify the video or the interpretation of the output.\n"

By looking at the distribution of frame-by-frame change values, a threshold can then be set for determining what changes are likely attributable to the animal moving versus random fluctuation.  Currently, a suggested cutoff of twice the 99.99 percentile is displayed.   A plot of grayscale change values is also provided.

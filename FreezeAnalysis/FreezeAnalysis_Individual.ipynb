    "The following code was designed in order to score motion/freezing data for a single video file. It allows for cropping of the video frame to reduce the influence of tethers. Motion is detected by capturing the number of pixels whose frame by frame grayscale change exceeds a user-defined motion threshold.  Freezing is then assessed by calculating when motion drops below a user-defined freezing threshold.  The user is able to visualize raw video, animal motion, and whether an animal is deemed to be freezing in order optimize parameters.  Final output is a csv that provides frame-by-frame motion and freezing across the session.  Additionally, a summary file can be generated that allows the user to get motion/freezing for specified time bins.  With the exception of setting the file path and a small number of parameters, the user can run through code.  \n",

    "`file` : The filename of the video, including the file extension.\n",

    "`start` : The frame of the video on which to begin processing.  0 is the first frame.  By knowing the video’s frame rate (e.g., 30 frames per second), the user can start processing the video at a specific timepoint.  For instance, to begin processing 20 seconds into the video, once the animal has been placed into the arena, one could enter 600 if the frame rate were 30 frames per second.  If you are uncertain of your video’s frame rate, this information will be printed by ezTrack when Cell 3 is run.\n",

    "`end` : The frame of the video to end processing on.  If the user would like to process from the start frame to the end of the video, this can be set to None.\n",

    "`dsmpl` : The amount to down-sample each frame.  If processing is going slow, down-sampling can help. A value of 1 indicates no down-sampling, while a value of 0.25 indicates that the frame will be down-sampled to ¼ the original size.  Note that if down-sampling is performed, all pixel coordinate output will be in the dimensions of the down-sampled video.\n",

    "`stretch` : Allows the user to alter the aspect ratio of the presented output.  This is useful when videos have irregular dimensions and are difficult to see (e.g., an aspect ratio of 1:100).  The width/height will be scaled by the factor provided. Note that this only affects the appearance of visualizations and does not modify the video or the interpretation of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Processing going slow?  Consider downsampling!***  Often times tracking does not not require 1080p or whatever high def resolution videos are sometimes acquired using. Try setting `dsmpl` to something lower than 1 to implement downsampling (1=no downsampling). For example, if set to 0.25, each frame will be downsampled to 1/4 the original size.  Note that the same downsampling value should be used during calibration."
